## Overview
The idea was to create a single page Todo App on a small screen. That would requiere a switch between several views : the view to create a project, the view to edit a project, the view to edit a todo, and the home page called 'welcome view'
My biggest has been the to make the data to persist on the screen using the localStorage. Still didnt manage to resolve that issue.
Problem : The data are written correctly on the localStorage, persist on the screen for the Project, but not for the todos that have been created.
Another issue with the localStorage was the selection of the project.. After refreshing the page, any project selected only target the first one, and project dont get add anymore.

So i had to disable/comment my try for the localStorage.
